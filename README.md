Facial Expression Recognition using ResNet-50
This project aims to recognize human facial expressions using the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architecture. The model is trained to classify facial images into one of several emotion categories such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.
Key Features
Uses the ResNet-50 deep residual network for feature extraction and classification
Supports training on popular facial expression datasets like FER2013
3

Provides scripts for preprocessing images, training the neural network, and evaluating performance
3
Includes utilities for detecting faces in images using techniques like MTCNN
Allows fine-tuning the pre-trained ResNet-50 model on custom datasets for improved accuracy
Supports bagging multiple ResNet-50 models for improved robustness and accuracy
Provides a simple interface for using the trained model to predict emotions in new images or video streams
